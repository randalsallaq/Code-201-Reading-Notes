An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

## The label Element

The `<label>` tag defines a label for many form elements.

The `<label>` element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.

The `<label>` element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the `<label>` element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

The for attribute of the `<label`> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.
