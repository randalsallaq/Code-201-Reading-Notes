## HEADINGS *
In markup language we have **6 levels** of headings:

`<h1>`

`<h2>`

`<h3>`

`<h4>`

`<h5>`

`<h6>`

**each one of these headings have a different size, a different usage and importance as well. We use the first heading to insert the main title, the second one to the next title and so**

***note***
> Headings are not only for formating text size. They are important for the search process and result.


## PARAGRAPHS
Paragraphs basically contains most of the content in the web page. Especially if this content is Articles. We separate paragraphs the same way we do it when we are writing on our papers or word document!

This means: **you can add as much paragraphs as you want**, by including the content between the paragraph tags:

`<p> this is a paragraph </p>`

`<p> this is another paragraph </p>`

CSS contains two parts:
- selector
- declaration
