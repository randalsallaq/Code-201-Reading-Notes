## HEADINGS *
In markup language we have **6 levels** of headings:

`<h1>`

`<h2>`

`<h3>`

`<h4>`

`<h5>`

`<h6>`

**each one of these headings have a different size, a different usage and important as well. We use the first heading to insert the main title, the second one to the next title and so**

***note***
> Headings are not only for formating text size. They are important for the search process and result.
