![b](https://ways2web.weebly.com/uploads/5/4/4/8/54485903/8033093_orig.png)


There is three types of lists in HTML:
*first*:

An unordered HTML list:

- Item
- Item
- Item
- Item


`<ul>`
`<li> item </li>`
`<li> item </li>`
`<li> item </li>`
`<li> item </li>`
`<ul>`


*second*:


1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item


`<ol>`
`<li> first item <li>`
`<li> second item <li>`
`<li> third item <li>`
`<li> fourth item <li>`
`<ol>`


*third*:

A description List"

`<dl>`
  `<dt>sun</dt>`
  `<dd>- The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as light and infrared radiation.</dd>`
  `<dt>moon</dt>`
  `<dd>- The Moon is an astronomical body orbiting Earth and is the planet's only natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System, and by far the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits.</dd>`
`</dl>`



we use these tag to write the list's codes:

`<ul>` **an unordered list**
`<ol>` **an ordered list**
`<li>` **a list item**
`<dl>` **a description list**
`<dl>` **a description list**
`<dt>` **a term in a description list**
`<dd>`**Describes the term in a description list**


# CSS Boxes
You can add boxes in CSS, control thier width, height, padding ...etc

"the CSS box model refers to how HTML elements are modeled in browser, and how dimension of those HTML elements are derived from CSS properties. It is a fundamental concept for the composition of HTML webpages."

# Arrays

![k](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/images/array-examples.png)

**Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets**

we create arrays in javascript using **var**:

`var colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];`
`var cars = ["BMW", "honda", "toyota", "mercedes"];`
`var drinks = ["juice", "tea", "coffee"];`


## comparasion operators :

these operators can either take numbers or any other value


`==	equal to`

`===	equal value and equal type`

`!=	not equal`

`!==	not equal value or not equal type`

`>	greater than`

`<	less than`

`>=	greater than or equal to`

`<=	less than or equal to`




## logical operators:


**|| (OR)**

`c = a || b;`


**&& (AND)**

`c = a && b;`


**! (NOT)**

`c = !a;`
