Debugging is the process of finding bugs i.e. error in software or application and fixings them. Any software program or product which is being developed undergoes through various steps â€“ testing, troubleshooting, maintenance in a different environment. These software programs or product contains some error or bug. These bugs need to be removed from the software to developed bug-free software. Debugging is nothing but a process that many software testers used to find those bugs and fix them. Debugging refers to finding bugs, analyzing, and fixings them. This process takes place when the software fails due to some errors or software performs an unwanted thing. Debugging looks simple but it is a complex task as there is a need to fix all errors at every stage of debugging.
