It is actually a complicated process, while it can be explained easily..
When the user wants to go to some specific website, their computer contacts a
network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS). While these DNS works bysending the computer an address with the domain name. Rhis address icludes 12 numbers seprated by periods and full stops. This number basically allows the user's browser to connect to the main server, where the user be able to access the required website.
