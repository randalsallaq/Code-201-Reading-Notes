# HTML Links..

HTML accept links o different directions. whether it was directly in the web or if it was  in another folder or file.
These links does not need to be texts. We can add in the HTML file links for images or other elements as well.

To add a link to the HTML file we use the attribute. `<a>`

EX:

`<a href="url">link text</a>`
`<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20Boolean,in%20the%20mid%2019th%20century.">booleans</a>`

* we have two main types for links in HTML:
1. Absolute URL:

"An absolute URL is the entire address from the protocol (HTTPS) to the domain name (www.example.com) and includes the location within your website in your folder system (/foldernameA or /foldernameB) names within the URL. Basically, it's the full URL of the page that you link to."
 
 2. Relative URL:
 
 The relative URL, on the other hand, does not use the full web address and only contains the location following the domain. It assumes that the link you add is on the same site and is part of the same root domain. The relative path starts with the forward slash and leads the browser to stay within the current site.

**The layout usually depends on the target**



# J.S Functions..


A function is the way to run the same code without really repeating it. So functions can contain a set of statements that will be repeated in JavaScript code.
The main reason behind using Functions is ti save time and effort, make the code more orgnized and clear as well.

EX:

`var person = {`

  `firstName: "John",`
  
  `lastName : "Doe",`
  
  `id       : 5566,`
  
  `fullName : function() {`
  
    `return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;`
    
 ` }`
 
`};`
